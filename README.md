Alternatively, it cannot be used if the avifenc command is not in the PATH.

## About Compression
Using avifenc not only puts a heavy load on the server, but it also causes a 504 error when there are many files.

Please compress it again.

## Uninstall

Disable and delete.

Delete all of wp-content/compressed-image.
